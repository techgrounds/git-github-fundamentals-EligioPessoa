# My Progress

--------

I read the introduction, and am starting to follow through on the optional steps.

# Difficulties

- I didn't know where to start
- Had to look up how to actually markdown, and the relevant syntax.
- Feel the need to copy from a template to understand how it looks like

# Coming steps

- Re-read this page in the coming days to better understand and internalize the processes.



 ## Additional difficulties
 
 - Formatting isn't working, need to find out why
 - Realized I needed to put .md at end of file, as extensions are not automatic. Testing now
